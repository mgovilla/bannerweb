# WPI Bannerweb

A mobile application for WPI students to access bannerweb from their phones. This app prompts the user for login information and can store it safely on the device, and then uses http requests to get user data from the bannerweb website.

Currently, the main feature is the schedule which detects the current term and requests the student schedule for it. A formatted version of the schedule is then displayed as shown below.
